# [Memory-Game](https://memorygame.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/public/index.html)
Card-based memory game.

- Users can start a new game (card layout randomized).
- Clicking a card reveals what’s underneath it. Keeps track and displays the number of times cards have been turned over as score.
- Users can only see at most two cards at a time.
- Clicking on two matching cards is a “match” — those cards stay face up.
- When clicking two cards that are not a match, they stay turned over for ~ 1 second before they flip over again
- Stores the lowest-scoring game in local storage (cookie), so that players can see a record of the best game played.
